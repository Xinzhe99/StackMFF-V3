## 💻 Usage

The pre-trained model weights files (`stackmffv3.pth` and `stackmffv3_star.pth`) should be placed in the [weights](https://github.com/Xinzhe99/StackMFF-V3/tree/main/weights) directory.

### Example

To fuse a stack of multi-focus images, organize your input images in a folder with numeric filenames (e.g., `0.png`, `1.png`, etc.):

```
input_stack/
├── 0.png
├── 1.png
├── 2.png
└── 3.png
```

Then run the prediction script:

```bash
python predict_one_stack.py --input_dir ./input_stack --output_dir ./results
```

This will generate four output files in the `./results` directory:
- `fused_gray_*.png`: Grayscale fused image
- `color_fused_*.png`: Color fused image reconstructed from the original color images
- `focus_indices_*.png`: Focus index map showing which source image contributed to each pixel
- `focus_colormap_*.png`: Colormap visualization of the focus indices

For additional options, see:
```bash
python predict_one_stack.py --help
```

abstract = {Multi-focus image fusion is a vital computational imaging technique for applications that require an extended depth of field, including medical imaging, microscopy, professional photography, and autonomous driving. While existing methods excel at fusing image pairs, they often suffer from error accumulation that leads to quality degradation, as well as computational inefficiency when applied to large image stacks. To address these challenges, we introduce a one-shot fusion framework that reframes image-stack fusion as a focal-plane depth regression problem. The framework comprises three key stages: intra-layer focus estimation, inter-layer focus estimation, and focus map regression. By employing a differentiable soft regression strategy and using depth maps as proxy supervisory signals, our method enables end-to-end training without requiring manual focus map annotations. Comprehensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. The resulting efficiency and scalability make the proposed framework a compelling solution for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments and lay the groundwork for broader practical adoption of multi-focus image fusion. The code is available at https://github.com/Xinzhe99/StackMFF-V2.}
